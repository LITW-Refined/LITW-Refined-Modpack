# Life in the Woods Refined

This is the name of my private modpack. It is based on [After Humans by Gronkh & Debitor](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/minecraft-after-humans.1060474/) wich is based on [Life in the Woods Renaissance](http://lifeinthewoods.ca/downloads.html). The modpack is intended to be more like LITW but with the possibility to use technic as you wish.

## Modpack repository

The [modpack repository on GitLab](https://git.pilzinsel64.de/litw-refined/modpack) holds all the configs, the builder and this readme. It's also the root for all modpack related tickets.

## Mods & mod repositories

On the [LITW Refined GitHub](https://github.com/LITW-Refined) you will find any Minecraft 1.7.10 mod made by me. You also find many open source mods I use that's development has been discontinued by the original mod author. I updated them for compatiblity, bugfixes and my own features. However, there are also a few forks I just have to contribute back to the original repositor.

Note that some of that mods are just forked and updated for reference and archive and from my side there is no active development.

Feel free to use it in your private or public modpack or contribute back any bugfixes or features you have on your side. Every contribution is welcome. 🙂
